# Multi-Query Retrieval in RAG: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide provides an overview of implementing a Multi-Query Retrieval system in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework using LangChain and OpenAI. The goal is to enhance document retrieval by generating multiple queries, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant and diverse results for improved response accuracy.

## Overview

### **Baseline RAG vs. Multi-Query RAG**
- **Baseline RAG:** Uses a single query for document retrieval, leading to potential limitations in retrieving diverse results.
- **Multi-Query RAG:** Generates alternative versions of the user’s query, increasing the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents from various perspectives.

## Key Steps

### **1. Environment Setup**
- Install necessary libraries, including `langchain`, `openai`, and `chromadb`.
- Configure the OpenAI API key to enable interaction with LLMs.

### **2. Vector Store Preparation**
- **Document Loading:** Use tools like `WikipediaLoader` to fetch content on relevant topics.
- **Text Splitting:** Divide documents into manageable chunks for embedding.
- **Embedding and Storage:** Convert text into vector embeddings and store them in a vector database (e.g., Chroma).

### **3. Multi-Query Generation**
- Utilize an LLM to generate multiple alternative versions of a user’s query. These alternative queries help overcome limitations of distance-based similarity searches.

### **4. Document Retrieval**
- Perform semantic searches using all generated queries.
- Merge and deduplicate retrieved documents to ensure comprehensive and unique results.

### **5. Final Answer Generation**
- Pass retrieved documents to an LLM with a structured prompt to generate a response based solely on the provided context.

### **6. System Comparison**
- Compare the performance of the **Baseline RAG** (single query retrieval) with **Multi-Query RAG** to highlight improvements in document relevance and response quality.

## Benefits of Multi-Query Retrieval
- **Enhanced Diversity:** Captures multiple perspectives on a query.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Retrieves more contextually relevant documents.
- **Better User Experience:** Delivers detailed and informed responses.

By implementing Multi-Query Retrieval, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your RAG system, enabling it to provide more accurate and contextually rich answers. This approach is especially beneficial for knowledge-intensive applications.
